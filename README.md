# Multimodal Emotion Recognition

*A Deep Learning Framework for Speech, Text, and Attention-Based Multimodal Emotion Classification*

---

## Overview

This project presents a multimodal emotion recognition system that combines **speech-based acoustic learning** and **text-based contextual understanding** for robust emotion classification.

The system was designed and implemented as an individual research-oriented project submission focused on:

* temporal emotion modelling from speech,
* contextual emotion understanding from text,
* and multimodal fusion using attention mechanisms.

The project evaluates and compares:

* Speech-only learning
* Text-only learning
* Feature Concatenation Fusion
* Attention-Based Fusion

A live deployment of the system is also available using Hugging Face Spaces.

---

## Key Features

* Speech Emotion Recognition using **Wav2Vec2 + BiLSTM**
* Text Emotion Recognition using **BERT + MLP**
* Multimodal Fusion using:

  * Feature Concatenation
  * Attention-Based Fusion
* t-SNE Visualization of learned embeddings
* Confusion Matrix and Training Curve Analysis
* Failure Case Analysis
* Live Streamlit Deployment on Hugging Face

---

## Architecture

### 1. Speech Pipeline

* **Feature Extractor:** Wav2Vec2
* **Temporal Modelling:** BiLSTM
* **Classifier:** Fully Connected Neural Network

The speech pipeline captures temporal acoustic patterns such as:

* pitch,
* tone,
* energy,
* and emotional prosody.

---

### 2. Text Pipeline

* **Feature Extractor:** BERT Embeddings
* **Classifier:** Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

The text pipeline focuses on contextual semantic understanding from textual emotion representations.

---

### 3. Fusion Pipeline

Two multimodal fusion strategies were implemented:

#### A. Feature Concatenation Fusion

Speech and text embeddings are concatenated directly before classification.

#### B. Attention-Based Fusion

An attention mechanism dynamically learns modality importance and improves feature interaction between speech and text representations.

## Experimental Results

| Model            | Architecture           | Accuracy   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Speech-only      | Wav2Vec2 + BiLSTM      | **95.36%** |
| Text-only        | BERT + MLP             | **12.50%** |
| Fusion Concat    | Feature Concatenation  | **84.46%** |
| Attention Fusion | Attention-Based Fusion | **92.14%** |

### Key Observation

The speech modality achieved the highest performance due to strong emotional cues present in acoustic signals.

Attention-based fusion significantly improved multimodal performance compared to direct feature concatenation by dynamically emphasizing informative modality features.

---

## Emotion Cluster Visualization

t-SNE visualizations were generated for:

* Speech embeddings
* Text embeddings
* Fusion embeddings

These visualizations demonstrate the separability of learned emotional representations across different modelling blocks.

---

## Failure Analysis

Several challenging emotion pairs were identified during evaluation:

| Actual Emotion | Predicted Emotion | Reason                            |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Happy          | Pleasant Surprise | Similar acoustic energy patterns  |
| Neutral        | Sad               | Low-intensity vocal expressions   |
| Disgust        | Angry             | Overlapping tonal characteristics |

The text-only model showed weak generalization due to limited semantic diversity in textual emotion cues.
